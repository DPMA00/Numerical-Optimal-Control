# Numerical Optimal Control

This repository contains a collection of exercises based on the online lectures of [numerical optimal control](https://www.syscop.de/teaching/ws2024/numerical-optimal-control) by Prof. Dr. Moritz Diehl from the University of Freiburg. All of these exercises are implemented in Python and use [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/docs/) for symbolic computation and algorithmic differentiation.
